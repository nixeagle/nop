Various useful links as I come across them:

* Keyboard
  http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html - Really good
  document on keyboard scan codes. Tells literally everything you might
  want to know about them in all the gory details.

* Spin locks
  http://lwn.net/Articles/267968/ - Talks about the implementation of
  ticket spinlocks in the linux kernel and explains to some extent why
  these are better then normal spin locks on machines with many cpus.
