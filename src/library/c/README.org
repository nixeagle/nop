This is a non standard compliant "C" library that takes advantage of some
C++ features like function overloading but this will not include classes
or templates.

As of [2010-08-10 Tue 06:34] there is no name for this C library. I'm
considering 'noc' (derived from 'nop', replacing the 'p' with 'c'), but I
think that is a poor choice.


I also plan to write a C++ library, (also likely not fully standard) as
well as take a try at writing a standard C++ and or C library just to see
how well I can do it ;). Extra things to make working with a lisp easier
from C would be interesting routes to explore with nop.
